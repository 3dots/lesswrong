I accept now. The identity that has come from the philosophies that I studied.

To be Jedi, you must but listen to yourself.

When the world tells you to move. You a move a little.

When the world tries to instill hate.
You smile instead.

When you are not certain about what to do.
Don't act.

If you don't have enough time. Find enough time.

Instill this light.

Watch over it. Don't shape it.

And every darkness you find. It is opportunity.

Fear is the mind killer. Don't let it win.

If they tell you that you must know the answer before you speak. Believe them.

If they don't believe you know it. Believe them.
_

If they tell you to change your mind.
Change you mind.

How much?
Enough.

How much is enough.
Just enough.

What is just?
A fraction.

What fraction.
What fraction worked best here last time?
_

The Jedi of fiction were weak.
Strength before weakness.
_

The jedi are information wizards.
There is no force.
Only information that was conducted.
processed, and received.

I choose to no longer believe the lies others tell me. The lies they tell themselves. The lies I accidentally told. Or in the belief of an absolute truth.

_

The sword of truth is very heavy.

The first rule of wizards.

People are vulnerable.
Everyone is vulnerable.

It does not make you weak.

It's is a strength. The greatest power.

To open.

To allow the death of others flow into you.

To make you greater. And... to look at life in a different way.
With even more compassion.
Never less.
