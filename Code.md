To be Jedi, you must but listen to yourself.

When the world tells you to move. You a move a little.

When the world tries to instill hate.
You smile instead.

When you are not certain about what to do.
Don't act.

If you don't have enough time. Find enough time.

Instill this light.

Watch over it. Don't shape it.

And every darkness you find. It is opportunity.

Fear is the mind killer. Don't let it win.

The sword of truth is very heavy.

The first rule of wizards.

People are vulnerable.
Everyone is vulnerable.

It does not make you weak.

It's is a strength. The greatest power.

To open.

To allow the death, pain and suffering of others to flow into you.

To make you greater. And... to look at life in a different way.
With even more compassion.
Never less.

# Rationality: A-Z

## Preface

# Map and Territory *The First Book*

## Biases: An Introduction: 

**Statistical Bias**: Skews samples so that they less closely resemble larger populations.

If your sampling is not biased, then your estimates about the large population won't be incorrect *on average*. The more you learn, the smaller your error will tend to be.

With Statistical Bias in your sampling, the more you learn the further you may skew your estimates away from reality.

Such samples maybe be unrepresentative *in a consistent direction*.

_

**Cognitive Bias**: A systematic way that your innate patterns of thought fall short of truth (or some other attainable goal, such as happiness).
Minds can come to undermine themselves, despite "learning" more.

**System 1 processes**: fast, implicit, associative, automatic cognition.

**System 2 processes**: slow, explicit, intellectual, controlled cognition.

**Cognitive Heuristics**: Rough shortcuts our brains have evolved to employ that get the right answer often, but not all the time. 

Cognitive biases arise when the corners cut by these heuristics result in a relatively consistent and discrete mistake. 

**Representativeness Heuristic**: our tendency to assess phenomena by how representative they seem of various categories.
            
Can lead to biases such as *conjunction fallacy* and *base rate neglect*.

**Conjunction Fallacy**: failing to grasp for all A,B: P(A and B) <= P(A).
            
The moral?  Adding more detail or extra assumptions can make an event seem more plausible, even though the event necessarily becomes less probable.

Experimental subjects considered it less likely that a strong tennis player would “lose the first set” than that he would “lose the first set but win the match.” Making a comeback seems more typical of a strong player, so we overestimate the probability of this complicated-but-sensible-sounding narrative compared to the probability of a strictly simpler scenario.

The sword of truth.

____

**Base Rate Neglect**: grounding judgments in how intuitively “normal” a combination of attributes is, neglecting how common each attribute is in the population at large.

Is it more likely that Steve is a shy librarian, or that he’s a shy salesperson? Most people answer this kind of question by thinking about whether “shy” matches their stereotypes of those professions. They fail to take into consideration how much more common salespeople are than librarians—seventy-five times as common, in the United States.[9]

**Duration Neglect**: evaluating experiences without regard to how long they lasted.

**Sunk Cost Fallacy**: feeling committed to things you’ve spent resources on in the past, when you should be cutting your losses and moving on.

**Confirmation Bias**: giving more weight to evidence that confirms what we already believe.

>Knowing about a bias, however, is rarely enough to protect you from it. In a study of bias blindness, experimental subjects predicted that if they learned a painting was the work of a famous artist, they’d have a harder time neutrally assessing the quality of the painting. And, indeed, subjects who were told a painting’s author and were asked to evaluate its quality exhibited the very bias they had predicted, relative to a control group. When asked afterward, however, the very same subjects claimed that their assessments of the paintings had been objective and unaffected by the bias—in all groups!

>Even when we correctly identify others’ biases, we have a special bias blind spot when it comes to our own flaws.

### Quotes:
>A rational person, no matter how out of their depth they are, forms the best beliefs they can with the evidence they’ve got.

>A rational person, no matter how terrible a situation they’re stuck in, makes the best choices they can to improve their odds of success.

>There are some problems where conscious deliberation serves us better, and others where snap judgments serve us better. 

>Our untrained intuitions don’t tell us when we ought to stop relying on them. Being biased and being unbiased feel the same.

The Sands of time.
Evervescent.

Blowing through our minds, our rocks and stones and orchards.
Creating intricate swirls of life and stone.

Dancing crystals of sand.
Swirling in patterns of thought, death and life.

You don't need to act.

Information will come.
_

When you are not certain about what to do.
Don't act.

If you don't have enough time. Find enough time.

When the world tries to instill hate.
You smile instead.

When the world tells you to move. You a move a little.

There is nooone else.
Nothing in the way.
_

Take a break.
Sit down.
Gaze upon the sun.

Imagine a series of steps.
A walk.
A dance.

Life is a tree.
Preserve it.

Guide it.
Shape it.
Mold it.

Define ranges.
Averages.

A frozen configuration.
A GRIP on time.
A grip on life.

A configuration file.
A hash.
A way to learn the way.

Encourage science.
Deep thought.
Respect.

Respect for knowledge.
For culture.
For our ways of life.

4 is to 1.
2 to 1.
And for all epsilon exists delta such that the average is bound.
So that variance is also bound.

Castles within time.
Stones put there for all time.

Not to be in the Way.
To point the way.
And *be* the way for young bright minds.
A catch all.

An exception handler.
A support system.
ways to keep classes stable.

Prevent corruption.
Forbid indecency, decadence.

BUT WAIT.
We aren't in the desert anymore.
